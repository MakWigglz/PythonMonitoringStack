A cloud-native monitoring stack typically consists of tools and services designed to monitor, log, and analyze the performance and health of applications running in cloud environments. A step-by-step plan to set up a basic cloud-native monitoring stack using Python:

Prometheus: For metrics collection.
Grafana: For visualization of metrics.
Alertmanager: For handling alerts.
Flask: A simple Python web application to monitor.
Prometheus Client: A Python client library to expose metrics to Prometheus.
Step-by-Step Plan
Set up a Flask application:

Create a simple Flask application.
Integrate Prometheus client to expose metrics.
Set up Prometheus:

Install and configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Flask application.
Set up Grafana:

Install Grafana and configure it to visualize metrics from Prometheus.
Set up Alertmanager:

Configure Alertmanager to handle alerts from Prometheus.

Goal: Build a cloud-native monitoring stack that showcases scalability and resilience using Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, a sample application, and the Prometheus client library.

Key Concepts:

Scalability: The ability of the system to handle increasing load (more requests, more data, more users) without significant performance degradation.
Resilience: The ability of the system to continue functioning correctly even when parts of it fail (e.g., a server crashes, a network connection is lost).
Quantifying Scalability and Resilience:

Scalability Metrics:

Throughput: Requests processed per second (RPS).
Latency: Response time (how long it takes to process a request).
Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, network bandwidth used.
Error Rate: Percentage of failed requests.
Horizontal Scaling: Show the ability to add more instances to handle more load.
Resilience Metrics:

Uptime: Percentage of time the system is available.
Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): The average time it takes to recover from a failure.
Fault Injection Success Rate: The system's ability to handle injected failures.
Alerts Firing: Number and type of alerts generated during failures.
Availability: Measure the percent of the time the system is ready to use.
Step-by-Step Plan:

Phase 1: Foundation (Basic Monitoring Stack)

Sample Application (Flask + Prometheus Client):

Create a Flask Application:
Build a simple Flask web application (e.g., a basic REST API) that simulates some workload.
Include multiple endpoints (e.g., /, /data, /process).
Expose Metrics:
Use the prometheus_client library to instrument your application.
Create metrics for:
Request Count: Counter for the total number of requests.
Request Latency: Histogram to track the duration of requests.
Request Errors: Counter for the number of requests that failed.
Gauge: To expose the system memory/CPU utilisation.
Custom Business Logic Metrics: Add metrics relevant to your app's purpose.
Metrics Endpoint:
Expose the metrics on a dedicated endpoint (e.g., /metrics).
Prometheus Setup:

Install Prometheus: Install Prometheus on a server or your local machine using Docker or a package manager.
Configuration:
Configure Prometheus to scrape the /metrics endpoint of your Flask application.
Set appropriate scrape intervals (e.g., 15 seconds).
Define labels in prometheus.yml to categorize different instances/endpoints.
Persistance: Configure persistance to keep data between runs, instead of losing everything.
Grafana Setup:

Install Grafana: Install Grafana on a server or your local machine.
Data Source: Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
Dashboards:
Create Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
Include panels for:
Request rate.
Latency percentiles (e.g., p50, p90, p99).
Error rate.
CPU and Memory Usage.
Any other application specific metrics.
Use Grafana's templating features to make dashboards more dynamic (e.g., filter by instance).
Alertmanager Setup:

Install Alertmanager: Install Alertmanager.
Prometheus Integration: Configure Prometheus to send alerts to Alertmanager.
Alert Rules:
Define alerting rules in Prometheus based on the metrics.
Example rules:
HighRequestLatency: Alert if the average latency is above a threshold.
HighErrorRate: Alert if the error rate exceeds a threshold.
HighCPUusage: Alert if the CPU is above a threshold.
AppDown: Alert if the app is down, no scrapes.
Notification Channels: Set up Alertmanager to send notifications (e.g., email, Slack).
Phase 2: Demonstrating Scalability

Load Generation:

Tools: Use a tool like locust or k6 to generate load against your Flask application.
Load Scenarios:
Ramp-Up: Gradually increase the number of concurrent users/requests.
Spike: Simulate sudden spikes in traffic.
Sustained Load: Maintain a constant high level of load.
Horizontal Scaling:

Containerization (Docker): Containerize your Flask app using Docker.
Orchestration (Docker Compose/Kubernetes):
Use Docker Compose to create multiple instances of your Flask application.
Alternatively, use Kubernetes to dynamically scale your application.
Load Balancing: Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx) to distribute traffic across the instances.
Prometheus Autodiscover: Use Prometheus features to autodiscover instances that can be scraped.
Monitoring Scalability:

Dashboard: Watch the Grafana dashboards during load tests.
Metrics to Observe:
Throughput: Is RPS increasing with more load?
Latency: How does latency change under load?
Resource Utilization: How much CPU/memory is each instance using?
Error Rate: Are we seeing more errors as load increases?
Scaling Effect: Show how adding more instances improves throughput and reduces latency.
Phase 3: Demonstrating Resilience

Fault Injection:

Simulated Failures:
Instance Failure: Stop/terminate one of the Flask application instances.
Network Partition: Simulate network connectivity issues (e.g., block traffic to/from an instance).
Service Crash: Force a crash or restart of one of the Flask application instances.
Resource Exhaustion: Simulate high CPU/memory usage to see how it affects the system.
Chaos Engineering Tools: For more advanced fault injection, consider using tools like Chaos Mesh.
Monitoring Resilience:

Uptime: Are requests still being served during failures?
MTTR: How long does it take the system to recover from a failure?
Alerts: Are the correct alerts firing when failures occur?
Dashboard: Watch the Grafana dashboard for signs of failure (e.g., increased latency, error spikes).
Log Analysis: Use logs to analyze what happened during a failure.
Availability: Monitor the app availability during failovers.
Phase 4: Presentation

Demo: Show the system in action. Demonstrate the scaling process and resilience, while showing the effect on metrics.
Explain:
How scaling works.
How resilience is achieved.
How the metrics are helping you understand the system's behavior.
Data: Use the data collected during the tests to back up your claims. Show the graphs.
Explain How to interpret metrics.
Future improvements: Explain how this system can be improved or expanded.
